# what have I done, and how I feel about it
Adding the high score list from the localStorage was extremely challenging, and hung me up for quite a long time. I've managed to get it some semblance of functional, but I still struggled to add the localStorage object properties to a string that could then be looped to add to the High Scores list, so I've settled for just adding what is presently available in the LocalStorage but it lacks the ability to repopulate what was previously keyed if the window is refreshed.
Otherwise, creating an array of questions for the quiz to pull from was probably the easiest part of this homework.
I think the next time I approach something like this, it might be easier to just keep the different "sections" of the javascript in separate .js files so it wouldn't be such a struggle to remember all of the variables I was assigning...

# what do I have left to do
Other than fixing the High Scores list, I still need to add a timer to the quiz itself but grew pretty tired after struggling with the High Scores list functionality, so I haven't gotten there yet... but I'm going to try to add it asap!!
